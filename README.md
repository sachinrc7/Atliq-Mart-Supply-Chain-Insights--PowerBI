Atliq Mart Supply Chain Insights- PowerBI

Background:

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) manufacturer based in Gujarat, India. They currently operate in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. Their goal is to expand to other major cities in the next two years.

However, AtliQ Mart is facing a problem where some important customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to issues with the service they received. It is believed that there have been instances where essential products were either delivered late or not delivered completely over a period of time, resulting in poor customer service. In order to address this problem before expanding to other cities, the management has asked their supply chain analytics team to monitor the delivery service levels, specifically the 'On-time delivery (OT) %', 'In-full delivery (IF) %', and 'OnTime in full (OTIF) %' of customer orders on a daily basis. This will allow them to quickly respond to any issues and improve their service.

The supply chain team has chosen a standardized method to measure the service level. They will calculate the percentage of orders delivered on time, the percentage of orders delivered in full, and the overall percentage of orders delivered on time and in full (OTIF %). These measurements will be compared against the target service level set for each customer.
